Tools for help ------- 

1. help50
troubleshoot problems in code

example code

int main(void)
{
   printf("hello, world!")
}

while compiling you will get error message like:-


Hello.c:5:5: error: implicitly declaring library function 'printf' with type 'int (const char *, ...)' [-Werror,-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
    ^
Hello.c:5:5: note: include the header <stdio.h> or explicitly provide a declaration for 'printf'
1 error generated.
make: *** [<builtin>: Hello] Error 1


Hello.c:5:5: means in the file hello.c there is an error found while compiling 5th line of code and the error was in 5th character of the line

these error codes might not always be handy to understand and can be quite frustating for  beginner so  to prevent that we will use a tool devoloped by cs50 staff called help50

help50 make Hello ---------write this while compiling to use the tool


and you will see results like :-

Asking for help...

Hello.c:5:5: error: implicitly declaring library function 'printf' with
type 'int (const char *, ...)' [-Werror,-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
    printf("Hello, world!\n");

Did you forget to #include <stdio.h> (in which printf
is declared) atop your file?

This is more User friendly and can help you at your initial stage of coding journey

2.style50

can give feedback on style of your code like adding comments , nice indentations

3.check50

check correctness of code rather than making it compilable in help50
helpfull during coding in your problem sets , lab
